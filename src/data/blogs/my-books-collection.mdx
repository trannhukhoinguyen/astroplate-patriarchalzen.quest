Hey there 👋! In this blog, I’m excited to share my book collection with you! So far, I own three books and have already finished two of them. These are books I’ve read purely for enjoyment, outside of any school reading lists.

- Since I read books on personal development, I wanted a change of pace with a love story.
- It’s an incredibly fun and romantic read! 💞

<H2>Bonus</H2>

If you’re in Hyderabad, here are some spots where you can find books at affordable prices:

1. The book van on DLF street
2. The book stall near Charminar in the mornings
3. Koti, where there are numerous book shops

Of course, digital copies of all these books are available online, but I highly recommend owning the physical copies. That’s all for this blog—✌️ peace!
