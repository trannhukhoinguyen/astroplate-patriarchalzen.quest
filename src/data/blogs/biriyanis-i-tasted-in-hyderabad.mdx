Hi there👋, today I'll share different places which are famous for biryanis that you can try out. Enjoy!

> Biryani = ❤️love

<H2>Madina Hotel</H2>

This is the first restaurant where I ate biryani in Old City. Mutton biryani🥘 was dope🔥

<H2>Hotel Shadab</H2>

**Most overrated restaurant**. When I visited Charminar for first-time, our plan was to eat at Shadab, but because of ⏰waiting-time we ate at Madina Hotel. Both hotels are opposite each other.

We ate Mutton biryani & some starters. Decent food. Try these items in the 🌞morning: Keema Roti🫔 very good😋

<H2>Nawaab's Restaurant</H2>

Mutton Biryani is very nice & juicy. Always over-crowded.
