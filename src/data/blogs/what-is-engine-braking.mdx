  Engine braking is way of decreasing speed of your bike without using brakes!

  how is that possible?

<Message>
  Release your throttle off & down-shift one gear at-a-time without using
  clutch. This will decrease bike speed and can save you in emergency
  situations!

- It's fine to use, but it's not recommended to down-shift at higher speeds
- Use this in emergency conditions, because it decreasing speed quickly compared to normal brakes
