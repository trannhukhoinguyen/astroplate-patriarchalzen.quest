Hey there 👋! In this post, I'll introduce TailwindCSS and explore how it improves upon traditional CSS. TailwindCSS is a modern way of writing CSS that powers website styling, including my own site!

<H2>Challenges with Traditional CSS</H2>

- **Repetition of Properties:** In my previous company, we used `CSS` and `SASS` for styling. Despite defining common classes, we often ended up creating new ones with similar properties, leading to redundancy.
- **Naming Conflicts:** Finding unique class names to prevent overlap became a constant struggle.
- **Larger Bundle Sizes:** Repeated properties across classes increased our CSS file sizes significantly.

<H2>Advantages of TailwindCSS</H2>

- **Utility-First Classes:** TailwindCSS provides utility classes that directly map to CSS properties, like so:

```html
<!-- Two divs styled with CSS and TailwindCSS -->

<!-- Traditional CSS -->
<style>
  .container {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
  }
</style>

<div class="container"></div>

<!-- TailwindCSS -->
<div class="flex items-center justify-center"></div>
```

- **Intelligent Autocompletion:** With IntelliSense support, class suggestions are automatically populated. Check out this [VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) for a streamlined experience🔥.
- **Simplified Class Naming:** No more brainstorming for unique class names 😮‍💨.
- **Built-In Design System:** Tailwind comes with a comprehensive design system out of the box📦.
- **Efficient Debugging:** With HTML and styles in one place, debugging is faster and simpler.

<H2>TailwindCSS Plugins🔌</H2>

Tailwind plugins add powerful enhancements to your app by extending the `tailwind.config` file. Here are a couple of my favorites👇:

**@tailwindcss/typography 😘**

- Ideal for styling typography-heavy content. This page, for instance, uses it for easy styling [learn more](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography).
- Widely used for blog and article content!

**tailwindcss-animate**

- Adds animation utility classes to your toolkit [learn more](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/tailwindcss-animate).

<H2>Learning path🛤️</H2>

- If you’re new to TailwindCSS, I recommend starting with a solid understanding of CSS.
- During build time, Tailwind classes are converted into CSS, so knowing the fundamentals of CSS will make Tailwind's utility-based approach feel like second nature.

<H2>What's next🤔</H2>

- Once you’re comfortable with Tailwind, you can choose a component library that complements it. Here are two paths:

  - **Tailwind-Compatible Libraries:** Examples include [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/accordion).
  - **CSS-Only Libraries:** If you prefer sticking to traditional CSS, consider [Material UI](https://mui.com/) or [Ant Design](https://ant.design/components/button).

  **Note:** Avoid mixing a CSS-based component library with Tailwind—it can lead to a messy setup😵‍💫.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more updates. Peace✌️
