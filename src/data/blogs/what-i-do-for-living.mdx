<H2>Under the hood</H2>

![Under the hood](/blog/what-i-do-for-living/under-the-hood.avif)

We're using NextJS for the frontend & PayloadCMS as our backend. These two things open doors for lot of possibilities. Now I'll share how we're leveraging PayloadCMS features!

<H2>Payload CMS</H2>

Before understanding what's PayloadCMS, let's understand what is CMS.

CMS -> Content Management System, you'll get admin interface where you can monitor or control few aspects of your website, here are few CMS examples: WordPress, ContentFul etc...

Unlike WordPress, ContentFul or Sanity, PayloadCMS integrates with your NextJS App-router so when you deploy your app your admin panel also gets hosted at /admin route

**Features**

- Comes with good Admin-panel UI
- You can use both sql & no-sql databases
- Comes with Access Control
- Automatic type generation🔥

I'll demonstrate one small example of Payload schema VS Traditional MongoDB schema👇

```typescript title="usersSchema.ts"
import { Schema } from "mongoose";

// So here we've traditional MongoDB schema
export const userSchema = new Schema(
  {
    name: { type: String, required: true, lowercase: true, trim: true },
    age: { type: Number, required: true },
  },
  {
    timestamps: true,
  }
);
```

Payload schema👇, here we generally call schema as collections

```typescript title="usersCollection.ts"
import type { CollectionConfig } from "payload";

// So here we're mapping the fields to payload schema
export const Users: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: "users",
  fields: [
    {
      name: "name",
      label: "Name",
      type: "text",
    },
    {
      name: "age",
      label: "Age",
      type: "number",
    },
  ],
};
```

so you need to add this collection to you **payload.config.ts** file, you'll have a collection on your admin panel.

<H2>Tailwind CSS 💅</H2>

For styling different themes we're using Tailwind CSS, Theming is quite easy in tailwind & by default comes with a good design-system. Tailwind typography-plugin is dope for blog-page styling. Learn more about [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
