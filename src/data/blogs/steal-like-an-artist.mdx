Hi there, I've read a book called **Steal like an artist**, this is the first book i read outside my schoolwork. I'll share things i liked in this book

<H2>Start copying</H2>

- Everything around you is a copied stuff with their own version
- You need not to copy all the stuff, copy the stuff which you ❤️love the most
- Original stuff is nothing but the copied stuff from 100 different sources
- I took inspiration from Beats and added my own version to it👇

<H2>Analog side✍️</H2>

- We're in a digital era, we do most stuff on laptop, phone like taking notes etc...
- I know this sounds funny😂. Use **Pen & Paper**, this can help you creatively and you write whatever stuff you want

- Even the blog your reading currently is written in Analog version first, even this website is designed on my book👇

<H2>🔁 Copy copy copy until you find yourself</H2>
