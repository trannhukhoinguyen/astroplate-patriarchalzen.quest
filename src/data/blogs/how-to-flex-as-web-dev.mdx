Hi there 👋! Today, I’ll share a few key things every web developer—or anyone in the software development field—should have. Bonus: you can totally flex these too!

<H2>Github Account</H2>

- Github is platform where you can store your code online, most of open-source development happens here. It's like instagram for developers
- Get comfortable with GitHub because it’s widely used for code storage, version control, and release management
- Start uploading your projects to GitHub. It’s a great way for recruiters to see your skills and what you’re capable of building

<H2>Website💯</H2>

- Owning a personal website gives you an incredible edge over others
- It establishes your online presence and lets anyone explore your work in real time
- Build a portfolio site to showcase your projects, skills, and experience in one place

<H2>Build Side Projects</H2>

- Side projects are a fantastic way to learn and grow. They allow you to experiment and apply what you’ve learned at work or elsewhere
- Yes, you’ll face challenges while building, but overcoming them is where the real learning happens
- For example, I learned React’s Context API by building my side project, [Savingspree](https://savingspree.vercel.app/)
- And don’t forget—you can feature these side projects on your portfolio

<H2>Showcase your Work💼</H2>

- Don’t just stop at building—share your work! Platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram are perfect for this
- For instance, I shared my portfolio website in a contest, and it ended up getting featured in a YouTube video. That exposure even led to someone reaching out to me for freelance work
