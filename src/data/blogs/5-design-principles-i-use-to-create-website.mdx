Hi thereüëã, today i'll explain the Design principles & tricks which i use to create website, so you can also build website which gives good browsing experience for your users.

> A good design simplifies the development process

<H2>Use less colors</H2>

You can build entire website by just using these <mark>3 colors</mark>, even my blog was build with same logic

- **Brand color** (use your brand-color for popup elements like buttons, links etc)
- **Background color** (choose between black or white, else lightest or darkest shade of your brand-color)
- **Font color** (choose the opposite color of your background color)

> Less colors = more consistancy

Here are few tools to visualize you website with different colors & check the contrast ratio using

- [Real time colors](https://www.realtimecolors.com/?colors=050315-fbfbfe-2f27ce-dedcff-433bff&fonts=Inter-Inter)
- [Shadcn Themes](https://ui.shadcn.com/themes)
- [RadixUI Themes](https://www.radix-ui.com/themes/playground)
- [Contrast checker](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/112a46-acc8e5)

<H2>2 Typefaces</H2>

Generally we go crazyü§Ø in this part using multiple font-families, but **2 font-families are enough for a website**, their are 2 categories in this font-family:

- **Display fonts** (the font which is used for headings, highlighting, etc)
- **Normal fonts** (the font which is used for body text)

Even my blog website is build on 2 font families

- [Virgil](https://virgil.excalidraw.com/)
- [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?query=inter)

**Bonus**

- Limit the sentence maximum width to **40 - 60 Characters** to increase readability
- This is a niche case, check for readability of letter **i,j** some font-families generally don't have difference between these letters

<H2>Single Icon Library</H2>

We can't skip using icons in our website, in this process we'll use icons from different providers, this can mess-up the website consistancy because we'll use 2-3 different styles at once it'll look odd

Maximum try to use single icon-library, here are few icon libraries i use the most

- [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)
- [Lucid icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/)
- [RadixUI icons](https://www.radix-ui.com/icons)

<H2>Visual Hierarchy with colors & sizes</H2>

You can change the importance of every element by using the colors & sizes, if you've 2 paragraphs you can change the importance of text just by adding gray color here is an exampleüëá

![Visual hierarchy](/blog/5-design-principles/readability.png)

Here i've made the heading bold & increased the font size so it grabs more attention, & next i've made the text gray to decrease it's importance

> In life we've limited amount of fucks, so choose them wisely

Everything doensn't need user attention, with visual hierarchy you can create a path for user to navigate

<H2>Accessibility</H2>

The most underrated & igonered one, even i too skip this most of the times, a good design must be accessible for all, here are few common use cases

- Form auto-submission on-press of <kbd>Enter</kbd> key
- Accessing all actionable-items(example: Buttons, Links) with tab key

You can learn more on [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility)

That's it for this blog, thanks for making it till here, my goal is one quality post per week. Stay tuned peace‚úåÔ∏è
