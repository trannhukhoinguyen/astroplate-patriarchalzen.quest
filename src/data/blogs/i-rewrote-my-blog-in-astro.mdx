import H2 from "../../components/MDXComponents/H2";

Hey there 👋! I've just migrated my blog from Next.js to Astro. In this post, I’ll dive into why I made the switch and highlight all the cool, out-of-the-box features Astro brings to the table! 😎

<H2>Why I Left Next.js😔</H2>

I was using Next.js 14 with Contentlayer, a solid setup for content-heavy sites.

**Highlights**

- Managing content was straightforward. Just set up a folder, configure your schema, and you’re ready to create `.md` or `.mdx` files.
- Types for the schema were generated automatically.
- MDX support was a bonus.

**Cons**

- Extending the config with plugins like syntax-highlighting was tedious.
- Contentlayer isn’t actively maintained.

If your still planning stick with Next.js, I recommend [content-collections](https://www.content-collections.dev/). I found it throught this [blog post](https://dub.co/blog/content-collections) very simple to integrate comes with MDX & Typescript support, and may be a good alternative to Contentlayer.

<H2>Getting to Know Astro🧐</H2>

In my case i know about astro earlier, it's popular for content-driven sites. Started checking few open-source repos using Astro, clonned there blog website starter template. Started replicating my Next.js app on Astro

**Features**

- MDX can be used with a plugin
- Syntax highlighting is built-in with ShikiJS.
- Content schema can be defined using Zod.
- Devtools are optimized and suggest helpful improvements. 🔥🔥🔥
- Easy for anyone with basic HTML and CSS knowledge to pick up.
- Excellent documentation 📙 and well-crafted starter templates.

**Challenges**

- Astro isn’t an SPA by default, unlike Next.js, but it can act like one if you use the ViewTransitions component.
- Astro generates everything statically by default, including API routes, which led to some trial and error when creating dynamic APIs.

<H2>Migration process</H2>

- First step i've created astro-app with blog template

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

- Copy pasted the public & directly paste in astron project no changes required there
- I've added necessary plugins React Components, TailwindCSS & Vercel for server side processing

```typescript
// astro.config.mjs file

// @ts-check
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";

// Here are my plugins specified👇
import mdx from "@astrojs/mdx";
import react from "@astrojs/react";
import sitemap from "@astrojs/sitemap";
import tailwind from "@astrojs/tailwind";
import vercel from "@astrojs/vercel/serverless";

import { transformerNotationHighlight } from "@shikijs/transformers";

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
  site: "https://blog.pavanbhaskar.com",

  // simply add those plugins here👇
  integrations: [mdx(), sitemap(), react(), tailwind()],

  // syntax highlighting comes by default no extra packages are required!
  markdown: {
    shikiConfig: {
      themes: {
        light: "dracula",
        dark: "everforest-light",
      },
      transformers: [transformerNotationHighlight()],
    },
  },

  vite: {
    optimizeDeps: {
      exclude: ["@resvg/resvg-js"],
    },
  },

  output: "hybrid",
  // vercel adpater is to handle dynamic API's or for Server side rendering
  adapter: vercel(),
});
```

- I've created a schema for content with Zod
  - So by default in astro content lives in `src/content` folder
  - In `content` folder i've created a blog folder & moved my `MDX` files there!
  - You can specify your content config in `config.ts` in `src/content` folder

```typescript
// config.ts file

import { defineCollection, z } from "astro:content";

const blogConfig = defineCollection({
  type: "content",
  // Type-check frontmatter using a schema
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    summary: z.string(),
    // Transform string to Date object
    date: z.coerce.date(),
    imageURL: z.string(),
    tags: z.array(z.string()),
  }),
});

// here i've exported blog with blogConfig
// Which means whatever content in src/content/blog folder will use blogConfig schema!
export const collections = { blog: blogConfig };
```

- I've created API routes with my page-view count & rate limiting API's logic
  - To create a API route which returns JSON you can create `route.json.ts` file
  - so if i hit `localhost:4321/route.json` i'll get JSON response
- Check here for more migration details [link](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/migrate-to-astro/from-nextjs/)

**How it improved content creation process**

- Astro’s markdown support is fantastic! 🔥
- It's a well-maintained project with a growing community. 🔥

Now, all that’s left is to keep creating content!
