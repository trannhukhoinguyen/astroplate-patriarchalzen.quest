Hi there üëã! Recently, I discovered some üíé gems that can optimize your website's images and videos without compromising quality!

<H2>üèûÔ∏è AVIF Format</H2>

If you're already familiar with image compression, you probably know about the WebP format, which is optimized for the web. Recently, I came across the AVIF format, and the results after compression are insane.

There‚Äôs a **huge** difference in image size after compression, with **no noticeable loss in quality**. Here are a couple of tools you can use for compression üëá:

**Squoosh Tool**

Squoosh is an open-source image compression tool by Google that supports a lot of formats. You can check it out [here](https://squoosh.app/).

Here are the results of compressing an image:

- **Before compression:** 2.92 MB
- **After compression:** 190 KB üî•
- **Browser support:** 92% (Check it at [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/?search=avif))
- AVIF format doesn‚Äôt support animated image compression (e.g., GIFs).

**Sharp JS**

Sharp is a popular image compression library for JavaScript. Here's an example of how you can compress an image to AVIF format using it:

```javascript title="compress.js"
import sharp from "sharp";
import path from "path";
import process from "process";

const rootDir = process.cwd();
const inputImagePath = path.join(rootDir, "/images/profile.jpg");
const outputImagePath = path.join(rootDir, "/images/compressed/profile.avif");

try {
  const response = await sharp(inputImagePath).avif().toFile(outputImagePath);
  console.log({ response });
} catch (error) {
  console.log({ error });
}
```

### üé• Handbrake

Handbrake is a video compression tool that I found when trying to embed a video into my company‚Äôs website. It compressed a video from 22 MB to **less than 1 MB**‚Äîwithout sacrificing quality!

Handbrake is free, open-source, and available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can get it [here](https://handbrake.fr/).
