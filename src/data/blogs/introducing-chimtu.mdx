  of course, crack some jokes 💯

  tales about **Biryani**!

  Chimtu it's your first day of duty, i don't want you get bored. Let me show you something cool I picked up from YouTube reels. Have you ever wondered what these <mark>~</mark> and <mark>^</mark> symbols in `package.json` mean?

```json
// ~ & ^ symbols in front of packages
{
  "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.59.16",
  "drizzle-orm": "~0.35.3"
}
```

  I’ve seen them a lot, but honestly, I have no clue 🤷‍♂️

I'll explain👇

  - Packages with the ^ symbol allow minor version upgrades, for example:
  5.59.16 → 5.60.0
</>

<>
  - Packages with the ~ symbol allow patch version upgrades, for example: 0.35.3
  → 0.35.4
</>

  ```json
// ~ & ^ symbols in front of package.json
{
  "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.59.16",
  "drizzle-orm": "~0.35.3"
}
```
</>

  Cool, but where can I see the exact package version that was downloaded?
</Message>

<Message>
You can find the exact version in your `package-lock.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml` file. Here’s an example:

```yaml
drizzle-orm:
  specifier: ^0.35.3
  version: 0.35.3(@libsql/client-wasm@0.14.0)(@neondatabase/serverless@0.10.1)(@types/pg@8.11.6)(@types/react@18.3.12)(react@18.3.1)
```

</Message>

<Message character="chimtu" direction="right">
  Got it! But what if I want to install an exact package version like `0.35.3`?
  Should I just remove the `~` and `^` symbols?
</Message>

<Message>Nice👍, that's it. You're getting a hang of it!</Message>
