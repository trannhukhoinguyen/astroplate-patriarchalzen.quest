Andre Kingston, known by his striking stage name Stardust Royale, is the modern face of glam rock. Hailing from Detroit, Michigan, Stardust Royale blends the theatricality and extravagance of 70s glam legends with a futuristic twist, creating music that is as daring as his iconic style.

His debut album, *Rebellion*, is a high-octane journey through soaring guitar solos, explosive anthems, and lyrics that celebrate individuality, freedom, and the unapologetic pursuit of self-expression. Inspired by greats like Freddie Mercury and T. Rex, Stardust Royale’s sound is larger-than-life, just like his persona.

On stage, Stardust Royale is pure energy and spectacle—glittering costumes, electrifying choreography, and an undeniable charisma that makes every performance unforgettable. Offstage, he’s a passionate advocate for creative expression and diversity in the music industry, using his voice to inspire a new generation of artists to break boundaries. Stardust Royale isn’t just a rock star—he’s a cosmic force of nature.
