Eleanor Wyatt, known on stage as Nora Wilde, is a rising star in the alternative folk scene. Hailing from Portland, Oregon, Nora weaves introspective lyrics with stripped-back guitar melodies, creating music that feels like a quiet conversation with an old friend.

Her debut album, *Still Waters*, is a soulful collection of songs that explore themes of solitude, self-discovery, and the beauty in life's quiet moments. Drawing inspiration from artists like Joni Mitchell and Phoebe Bridgers, Nora Wilde's sound is both timeless and refreshingly contemporary.

On stage, Nora captivates her audience with an understated yet compelling presence, letting her voice and guitar speak volumes. Offstage, she’s an advocate for sustainability and often incorporates her love of nature into her music and visuals. With her poetic storytelling and delicate yet powerful melodies, Nora Wilde is redefining what it means to be a modern folk artist.
