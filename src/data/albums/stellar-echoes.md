**Stellar Echoes** is the second album by synthwave artist Echo Lume. Building on the success of *Neon Dreams*, this album explores cosmic themes with haunting synths, pulsating beats, and cinematic soundscapes. Tracks like *Neon Voyage* and *Starlight Symphony* take listeners on an intergalactic journey through the dreamy landscapes of synthwave.
